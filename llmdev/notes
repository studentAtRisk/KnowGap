- record all answers in JSON format for convenience
for each question,
- ask ollama for topics / subject / general idea of the problem
- record the answer as a hint for next questions
- ask ollama to describe a youtube search query that could find a useful video given the subject matter
to test:
* we want to be able to quantify the performance of ollama
- use a separate model to look at the query, and describe how accurate
it is to the problem, whether or not it might help find a helpful video
- maybe use gpt for the time being, giving a percentage rating of helpfulness
- human / manual checking over each iteration
