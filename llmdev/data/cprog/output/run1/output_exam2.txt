Search Query: Let's break down these C programming questions.

**Answers and Explanations**

1. **(c) Reads a line from standard input**  `gets()` reads a whole line (including spaces and up to a newline character) from standard input.

2. **(b) Reads a single character from standard input** `getchar()` reads a single character at a time from standard input.

3. **(d) Writes a single character to standard output**  `putchar()` writes a single character to standard output.

4. **(c) 2**
   - The expression `x = x++ + 1` is evaluated as follows:
     - `x++`: This increments the value of `x` *after* it's used in the current expression (so `x` remains 0).
     -  The result of `0 + 1` is 1.
     - The value of 1 is then assigned back to `x`.

5. **(a) It controls compiler-specific features** `#pragma` directives provide instructions for the compiler, often related to optimization or specific language extensions.

6. **(a) It returns a pointer to NULL** When `malloc()` fails to allocate memory (usually due to insufficient memory), it returns `NULL`. 

7. **(c) 3**
   - The bitwise AND operator (`&=`) compares each bit of the operands. In this case, `5` in binary is `0101` and `3` is `0011`.
   - Performing a bitwise AND results in `0001`, which is equal to 1 in decimal.

8. **(d) All of the above**  These are standard C preprocessor directives:
     - `#define`: Defines macros (text substitutions).
     - `#include`: Includes header files into your code.
     - `#undef`: Undefines previously defined macros.

9. **(b) It closes an open file** `fclose()` is used to close a file stream that has been opened using `fopen()`. 

10. **(d) %l** The correct format specifier for a long double (double with extended precision) is `%Lf`.
