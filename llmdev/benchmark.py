    Take the following question and generate an effective YouTube video search query that will help someone find educational videos to study the topic. The search query should:
    Be concise and include the most relevant keywords and phrases from the question.
    Optimize for YouTube's search algorithm by considering common video titles and descriptions.
    Avoid unnecessary words or details that don't aid in finding helpful videos.
    Avoid formatting, quotes, or otherwise modifying the query. Only return the words in the query.
    Consider the context that this question might appear in, such as which part of a course or series
    and use that to help generate the query, if it is helpful.
